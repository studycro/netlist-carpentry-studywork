        Converts an integer value into a dictionary of Signal objects.

        It handles the conversion of standard Python integers (including negative values)
        into a binary string representation before mapping them to signal indices.

            - **Positive Integers:** Converted to their standard binary representation.
            - **Negative Integers:** Converted using **two's complement** representation.
              The bit-width for the two's complement is determined by `fixed_width`.
              If `fixed_width` is not provided, it defaults to the minimum number of

            msb_first (bool, optional): Determines the bit-indexing direction.

                - This parameter is passed directly to :meth:`from_bin`.
            fixed_width (Optional[PositiveInt], optional): The desired bit-width.
                - For negative numbers, this defines the wrap-around point for the
                  two's complement logic.
                - If the integer requires fewer bits than `fixed_width`, the resulting
